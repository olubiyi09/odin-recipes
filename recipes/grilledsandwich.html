        <h2>About Grilled Cheese Sandwich</h2>
        <p>A grilled cheese is a hot sandwich typically prepared by heating one or more slices of cheese between slices of bread, with a cooking fat such as butter, on a frying pan, griddle, or sandwich toaster, until the bread browns and the cheese melts.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound cake, cut into 1/2-inch slices</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup white frosting</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon yellow food coloring, or as needed</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon red food coloring, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps To Cook Fried Rice</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> <strong>Step 1</strong><br> Spread butter on both sides of each pound cake slice.</li>
            <li> <strong>Step 2</strong><br> Heat a griddle over medium heat. Cook cakes slices on hot griddle, turning once, until golden brown on each side, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer cake slices to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li> <strong>Step 3</strong><br>  Stir frosting, yellow food coloring, and red food coloring together in a bowl until frosting is the color of American cheese.</li>

        </ol>
