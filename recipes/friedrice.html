        <h2>Steps To Cook Fried Rice</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the rice and sauté for 3-5 minutes, until toasted.</li>
            <li>Add 2 cups of stock to the rice, stir and cook on low heat, with the lid on for 12-15 minutes, or till stock is absorbed and rice has softened a bit. Let cool for 5-10 minutes, then fluff and set aside.</li>
            <li>In another pot, heat up the remaining 2 tablespoons oil till hot, then add the hard vegetables. Season with a pinch of salt and stir fry for 2-3 minutes before you add the soft mixed vegetables. Let cook, another 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Season to taste with curry powder, dried thyme, black/white pepper, turmeric powder.</li>
            <li>Add the rice and stir gently, but well, so rice and vegetables combine. Add 1 cup of stock and the coconut milk, cover the pot and cook on low-medium heat for 10-15 minutes or till the rice is al dente.</li>
            <li>Check for doneness and seasoning, and adjust accordingly. Add more stock if required.</li>
            <li>When rice is ready, stir in chopped liver, sautéed shrimp and diced green bell peppers. Cook for 3-5 minutes. Remove from heat and serve.</li>
